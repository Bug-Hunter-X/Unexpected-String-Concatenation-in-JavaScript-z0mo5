This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript: implicit type coercion leading to unexpected string concatenation. The `foo` function intends to add two numbers, but due to JavaScript's loose typing, when a number and a string are passed as arguments, it performs string concatenation instead of numerical addition.  The solution shows how to avoid this using type checking or explicit type conversion.
